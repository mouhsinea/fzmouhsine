The Project Idea : Image Caption Generator

As we know humans can understand an image easily but computers are far behind from humans in understanding the context by seeing an image.
Caption generation is an artificial intelligence problem where a textual description must be generated for a given photograph.
It requires both methods from computer vision to understand the content of the image and a language model from the field of natural language processing to turn the understanding of the image into words in the right order.
