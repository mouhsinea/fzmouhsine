The Project Idea : Image Caption Generator

As we know humans can understand an image easily but computers are far behind from humans in understanding the context by seeing an image.
Caption generation is an artificial intelligence problem where a textual description must be generated for a given photograph.
It requires both methods from computer vision to understand the content of the image and a language model from the field of natural language processing to turn the understanding of the image into words in the right order.
In this Python based project, we are going to build models that can generate captions for an image where we will use deep learning techniques of Convolutional Neural Networks and a type of Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM) together.

For our python based project, we will be using the Flickr_8K dataset.
